> A full day testing workshop complete with application, exercise tests and speaker slides for [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Requirements

- Any computer: Mac, Windows, Linux
- [Node 12.0.0+ (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/), check [GH workflow file](.github/workflows/min-node-version.yml)
- [git](https://git-scm.com)

In order to get the code and install dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress.git
cd testing-workshop-cypress
npm install
```

If necessary, install dependencies inside TodoMVC folder

```bash
cd todomvc
npm install
```

### Quick check âœ…

You can test the installation by starting TodoMVC in the first terminal window

```shell
cd todomvc
npm start
```

and you should see in the terminal

```text
> json-server --static . data.json --middlewares ./node_modules/json-server-reset


  \{^_^}/ hi!

  Loading data.json
  Loading ./node_modules/json-server-reset
  Done

  Resources
  http://localhost:3000/todos

  Home
  http://localhost:3000
```

Note for Windows users: if `npm start` throws an error, it is probably due to `cd todomvc; ...` first command in the `npm start `script. In this case change the working folder to "todomvc" and run `npm start` from there.

From the second terminal window you should be able to open Cypress in the root of the project with

```bash
$ npm run cy:open

> testing-workshop-cypress@1.0.0 cy:open /git/testing-workshop-cypress
> cypress open
```

### Tip

You can use the installed [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) utility to start the app, open Cypress and then shutdown the app when you exit Cypress.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Application ðŸ’¾

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) + REST server application that we are going to test is in the folder `todomvc`. This application and its full testing is described in [this blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2017/11/28/testing-vue-web-application-with-vuex-data-store-and-rest-backend/). The application should run fine without network access.

## Slides ðŸ–¥

See the presentation at [https://testing-workshop-cypress.netlify.app/][presentation]. Every section of the presentation has a subfolder in the [slides](./slides) folder with a Markdown file. The Markdown is rendered into HTML using [Vite and Reveal.js combination](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/reveal-vite/). You can open the presentation by clicking on "link" in the table below.

## For speakers ðŸŽ™

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/de48e52e-e2ee-4092-a626-ab4fa358e441/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/testing-workshop-cypress/deploys)

This workshop can take all day, but you can pick the sections you are interested in teaching at will and customize it into any time duration. Everyone is coding for the most part, except for CI and the Cypress Dashboard sections, where the usage was shown via slides and actual sites.

During the workshop, keep the `todomvc` app running in one shell, while each section `01-basic`, `02-...`, `03-...` etc. has its own Cypress and specs subfolders `cypress/integration/...`. Usually a spec has several tests with placeholder comments. The workshop attendees are expected to make the tests pass using the knowledge from the slides and hints (and [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/)). Note that most folders have a prepared `spec.js` file and an `answer.js` file. The `answer.js` file is ignored by Cypress using a setting in `cypress.json`.

The only exception is the folder `00-start`. This is a folder for students to see how Cypress scaffolds example specs when you open Cypress for the very first time. In this folder students should execute...

```
cd 00-start
npm run cy:open
```

...and see the list of created example specs.

The slides are generated using Reveal.js from Markdown sources in the [slides](slides) folder. You can show the slides locally by running

```shell
npm run slides:dev
```

The slides are deployed to Netlify automatically, see [https://testing-workshop-cypress.netlify.app/](https://testing-workshop-cypress.netlify.app/)
