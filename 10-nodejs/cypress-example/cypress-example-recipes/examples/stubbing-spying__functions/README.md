# stubbing-spying__functions
> Shows how to control dependencies during tests using cy.spy and cy.stub

Shows how to load application code directly from the spec code and shows how to:

- use [`cy.spy()`](https://on.cypress.io/spy) to assert that expected calls were made
- use [`cy.stub()`](https://on.cypress.io/stub) to replace actual methods calls with synthetic responses
- Handle promises returned by stubbed functions.
- Handle callbacks in stubbed functions.
